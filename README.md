# Why Use uv?

uv is a modern and fast Python package manager that helps in managing dependencies efficiently. It is an alternative to pip and venv and provides several benefits:

Faster installation of dependencies compared to pip

Lightweight virtual environments, making it more efficient

Better dependency resolution, avoiding conflicts

Cross-platform support with optimized performance

Using uv, you can quickly set up a virtual environment and install required packages with minimal overhead.

The application evaluates the password based on predefined security rules using regex.

The strength of the password is displayed on the screen.
